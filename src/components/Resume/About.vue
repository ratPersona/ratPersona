          <h3>Software Developer | UX Guru</h3>
          <div>
            <p>My name is <strong>Sam</strong>, and I'm just an <strong>empthatic human</strong> who loves <strong>video games</strong>, <strong>animals</strong>, <strong>art</strong>, and <strong>dunkin' on bad app design</strong>.</p>
            <p>I'm an animal enthusiast (from rats, to snakes, to chickens and more!) and I care greatly about environmentalism, ecology, biology, and just spending time with all my little friends!</p>
            <p>I read way too much <strong>romance literature</strong> and I have a <strong>Bob's Burgers</strong> or <strong>Gilmore Girl's</strong> quote for any situation!</p>
            <p>I will rant ceaslessly about three things: <strong>bad app design</strong>, <strong>people who shouldn't have animals</strong>, and <strong>the plotpoints of my favorite shows and why they're good or bad</strong></p>
