    "<p>Good news, everyone! The site is, for all intents and purposes, “live”!</p>

      <p>If you’re reading this, salut! Welcome to my site. More specifically, welcome to my vblog! I’m so happy you’re here to share my triumphs, rants, and general opinions with me.</p>

      <p>I suppose an introduction would be nice, right? My name is Sam, and as you may have read on my landing page – I have a LOT going on. I always say one of my favorite hobbies is having too many hobbies. The reason I wanted to start vblogging was because I enjoy sharing my many envoys with people. I’m a huge, giant, ridiculous nerd when it comes to all my personal and professional interests, and sometimes I even consider myself entertaining. That, plus the desire to showcase my efforts as a developer and my work as an artist, resulted in this lovely conglomeration.</p>

      <p>Now, listen, my brain is a mess. If you’ve seen my house, you’d agree. There’s a lot going on up there and in the words of Lorelai Gilmore, “It’s a big bag of weird in there!”</p>
      ((monkey monkey underpants gif here))
      <p>So I’m going to do my best to articulate my opinions and thoughts (professional or otherwise!) in an interesting and refreshing way. I hope to captivate readers with the variety of topics I’ll be providing you with. Additionally, my journey as a Master of User Experience will be documented here along with my projects and findings! So really, it’s going to be 50% nerd and 50% “sam-why-are-you-spending-so-much-time-dissecting-the-relationships-in-grey’s-anatomy”.</p>

      <p>Thanks so much for joining me here! Check out my youtube channel at: [LINK]</p>
